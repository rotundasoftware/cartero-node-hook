> DEPRECIATION NOTICE: At long last, cartero has been depreciated. As the first multi-page application build tool, cartero served its purpose well for many years. However now there are far more robust and better supported tools that can be used to achieve the same goals. We recommend migrating any projects still using cartero to [Web Pack](https://webpack.js.org/). Thank you to everyone who contributed to this pioneering project.

# cartero-node-hook

A hook for [cartero](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/cartero) implemented in Node.js.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rotundasoftware/cartero-node-hook.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rotundasoftware/cartero-node-hook)

## Installation
```
npm install cartero-node-hook
```

## Usage

```javascript
var hook = require( 'cartero-node-hook' );
var path = require( 'path' );

var h = hook( path.join( __dirname, 'static/assets' ) );

// get the html tags to load the js and css assets associated with
// an entry point for which cartero was run.
h.getTagsForEntryPoint( entryPointPath, function( err, tags ) {
  // tags.script is a string of <script> tags
  // tags.style is a string of <link> tags
} );
```

Using Express? [cartero-express-midddleware](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/cartero-express-middleware) automatically populates `res.locals` with the `script` and `link` tags for the view being rendered.

## API

### h = hook( outputDirPath, options );

`outputDirPath` is the absolute path to your cartero output directory, as passed into cartero at build time. `options` may contain:

* `outputDirUrl` (default: '/') - the base url corresponding to the cartero output directory relative to the domain root.

* `appRootDir` (default: undefined) - The root directory of your application. (You generally only need to supply this option if the directory structure of the system on which your application is being run is different than of the system on which cartero was run.)

* `cache` (default: true) - whether or not to cache meta data. Set to `false` in dev mode so that you don't need to restart your application when assets are changed.

### h.getTagsForEntryPoint( entryPointPath, cb )

Get the HTML tags to load the script and style assets for a JavaScript entry point.

```javascript
h.getTagsForEntryPoint( '/usr/rotunda/my-app/views/page1/page1.js', function( err, tags ) {
	// tags.script is a string of <script> tags
	// tags.style is a string of <link> tags
} );
```

### h.getAssetsForEntryPoint( entryPointPath, cb )

Returns a hash of asset paths keyed by asset type. All paths are relative to the output directory.

```javascript
h.getAssetsForEntryPoint( '/usr/rotunda/my-app/views/page2/page2.js', function( err, assets ) {
	console.log( assets.style );  // array of paths (ex: [ 'url/to/bundle.css' ])
}
```

### h.getAssetUrl( assetPath )

Returns the url of the asset with the absolute path `assetPath` using metaData.json assetMap

```javascript
h.getAssetUrl( '/usr/rotunda/my-app/views/page2/photo.png') //'url/to/package/img/photo_sha.png'
```

## Change log

### v0.3.2

* Add option to support set the `crossorigin` attribute in script tag.

### v3.0.0

* Changed `getAssetUrl` implementation (looks in asset data in the metaData created by cartero)

### v2.0.0

* Changed `getParcelTags` to `getTagsForEntryPoint` and `getParcelAssets` to `getAssetsForEntryPoint`

### v1.0.0

* Removed `parcelDirPath` argument from initializer. (No longer needed since parcel paths are now stored in meta data as absolute paths.) Note this is an API change that will affect **all users**. Just get rid of the first argument to the intializer and you'll be good to go.
* `cacheParcelData` option changed to just `cache`
* Other assorted tweaks to work with new metaData.json file from cartero v3.0.0. You *must* use cartero >= v3.0.0 with this hook.

### v0.3.1

* First version in this change log.
